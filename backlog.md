This week, we need to focus on implementing CSS and JavaScript based on the prototype page. (It is recommended to mock the data yourself.) If Dhian still does not receive a response from the unit chair, we will proceed with Materialize CSS and EJS to complete the work.

Tasks for this week:
1. Implement CSS and JavaScript based on the prototype.
2. Complete the required fields for the data model.

In the next meeting, we will discuss these points.
